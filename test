1. What are your motivations for seeking a new role?
I’m looking to move into a technology-driven or deep-tech company where software, AI and platforms are the primary product and growth engine.
My strongest value comes from combining strategy, innovation, and product direction with large-scale engineering execution. Over the past years, I’ve led global organizations delivering complex cloud and AI platforms, and I’m now seeking an environment where software, data, and AI products sit at the core of the business model, with direct ownership over roadmap, differentiation, and commercial outcomes.
Having gained significant experience operating at scale in a large, infrastructure-oriented organization, I’m motivated to apply that leadership in a more product-centric context, where software excellence directly drives market impact and long-term growth.
2. In addition to the role applied for, what are your top 2–3 ideal positions?
VP of Engineering / Head of Engineering with end-to-end ownership of core software products or platforms.
Product-oriented CTO in a technology-led or deep-tech company.
Senior engineering leadership roles in product-first businesses where software is the primary value driver.
3. Location preference? Notice period? Work visa? Work model?
Work model: Onsite or hybrid, with structured flexibility
Mobility: I’m accustomed to operating globally and currently split my time across multiple regions. Ideally, I’d maintain the flexibility to spend approximately one week per month in Greece, which has been fully compatible with my executive responsibilities.
Location: Open to Cyprus, UAE, Switzerland, Netherlands, UK
Notice period: [insert your notice period]
Work visa: EU citizen (no visa required for EU roles); open to sponsorship if required outside the EU
4. Please briefly share any additional information to support your application.
My background spans end-to-end product ownership, engineering leadership, and platform strategy across regulated and large-scale environments. I’ve led transitions from legacy systems to cloud-native, AI-enabled products, owned marketplace and SaaS platforms, and driven measurable outcomes across cost efficiency, delivery speed, and customer adoption.
I’m equally comfortable operating at executive level with boards and stakeholders, and at architectural depth when shaping critical technical decisions.
5. Desired salary range
Compensation is location- and structure-dependent. As a reference point, I’m seeking a package equivalent to my current level, which is approximately €160k base plus ~25% long-term equity, with upside beyond that for increased scope, impact, or cash-heavy structures.
For senior mandates, my target is €250k+ total compensation, adjusted for geography, tax regime, and the balance between cash and equity.
6. What’s your dream job if there were no limits?
A deep-tech or AI-driven scale-up operating at global scale, where I serve as VP Engineering or CTO, helping push technology boundaries while building high-performance teams, scalable platforms, and products that define their category.
